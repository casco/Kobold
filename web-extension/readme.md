# Kobold event interception ewb-extension

In order to work, Kobold needs to incercept and record events that take place while using your web application. This is achieved via incerception code that is injected in all of your application's web pages. 

This web-extension, once installed in your browser (Chrome of Firefox only), will intercet UI events in all pages from all sites. Interception behaviour will stop once you uninstall the web-extension and restart your browser.

This web-extension captures events and reports them to a remote server. You can configure the address of the server (i.e. your own) in the options page. 

Event reports must be associated to a Kobold project token. You can set the token in the options page. You can obtain your token in the "tracking code" tab in your Kobold account.
