	^'A form contains a list of items, and each one has a checkbox. Users can perform different actions over a subset of those items by first selecting some of them using those checkboxes, and then selecting an action. However most of the time users only apply the actions on a single item at a time rather than many, rendering these mechanics overly complicated.'
